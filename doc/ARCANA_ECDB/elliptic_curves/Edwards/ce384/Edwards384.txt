Elliptic curves under Edwards form of  order n=4*prime over a finite prime field F_p
*************************************************************************************
size(p) : about 384 bits
x^2 +y^2= 1+d*x^2*y^2

d is built from a random numbers rd by the following equation:

 d = hextodec(sha512.hex("dec(rd)"))  modulo p

We give also a point (gx,gy) of the group of the elliptic curve
This point is random and is of order n or n/2 or n/4 (t=0,1,2)

  gx = hextodec(sha512.hex("dec(r)"))  modulo p

(we draw a random r, compute gx by the previous formula, test if 
z = (1-g*x^2)/(1-d*gx^2)
is a square, if yes, we compute gy, if no, we draw an another r)
